<p>Hello everyone! You might know me from some of my past projects.</p>
<p>I'm a software developer passionate about building creative solutions and sharing knowledge with the community.</p>
<p>I also live with Bipolar and ADHD — it can make things a bit unpredictable at times, but it's part of what fuels my creativity and resilience.</p>
<p>You can check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/neekaru" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
