content: i maybe late to realize something but i think i'm gonna failed for this not same as other, ##but## something in my head yeah i'm gonna failed for this, ##i waste## everyone time i don't know how i express with but in the end i feel everyone is same place can be failed or success but uhm in my case i'm failed idk hate being as stupidity and want to survive to be not like that, but uhm i don't know everyone else looks busy rather then before and i feel sometime, i feel so spesial but in the end everyone not gonna change to whatever is more like suporting or something and do realize that ##everyone have their business## i think maybe since 4 weeks prior my schedule for sleep become sucks and i cannot sleep in normal clock due to PTSD somebody that call me on 10-11 PM, but yeah it's just other day in the end i feel everyone maybe try to love yourself not be like me that i hasn't love myself and taught that i was kinda failed person or maybe not but i feel that so yeah see ya
