**I Remeber** Correctly sometimes around july or august, the problem is right now, i'm not enjoying with the current management, because i realize they actually not supporting and be like somebody that i dosen't want to

*I Tried* my self to confident yesterday, but what i got just kinda tired at some point, that i realize i need to rest full for today i rest full because no body will listen, your complains unless they you do special to them, but current problem is i don't understand the current managemnt that actually my new **lecturer**, but tried myself to confident, but i some point i got enough, they ask me to do what i don't want to do, i want to scream but sometimes, i realize, maybe i need to sacrifice to myself, i don't confident enough, i just another person

who stupid enough, that i realize maybe i need to step out for it, but now i wonder why, i see myself as not confident as yesterday, like today **he** ask me to checking again, but i already told them i already do that, i ask to stright to the boss, but i realize, on this night i feel like am, who am i just kinda try to become **Bro** enough, but i realize that everything is not same anymore, and maybe 3-6 months after this i need to exit of it, because i don't safe right now, i feel that everyone just hate me, more and more and what i'm done just the rest of history, i tired already, everything they say become teacher, become developer or something is not fun anymore, i tired is not happy anymore, i tried myself to just stright happy, because i realize, my dream is killing me right now, i maybe need to stop learning or coding, because i realize i'm actually become a crazy person, i wish no one will find me, i tired they make's me not happy

i just stupid, ipk or whatever it is just stright killing my dream already, i tried myself to confident until i realize i'm not become myself, i wish no one will find out, because i tried to be happy to every single hours, day, seconds, i just want to stop that, i stupid yeah i stupid no one is stupid, i'm just stupid, my mom hates me, my dad's hate's, why i'm not just killing my dream already i tired, i tired, please stop, i need to figure out myself, is i'm already worth of the idea i have or just illusion i have
