*I* Realise something i cannot quit any more i mean for sure any day just looks like the same i mean i was too tiring, 

**Seems** like what i did i failed for tiring reasons yeah i know couple months ago, i not working i just maybe the kinda word is *Internship* Whatever the call i did i just realise i working maybe with someone i know passionate but i realize i not capable to do that every thing i did from 2 months ago seems like kinda trash for somebody 

I know my mistake was back in 2023, i was too passionate back then but realize in 2025, i feel waste my time, i become sicks for some reasons, due to my *Internship* is too forcing me too much but seems like <a href="https:*id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangguan_pemusatan_perhatian_dan_hiperaktivitas">ADHD</a> and My fucking hate it all the time <a href="https:*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar</a>, it's make me on the road, i feel need Free for some reasons but after i told that to my Parents about that, they told me That *I Should keep going, because you're too late*, And i say *Maybe if that's this time cycle keep going, idk but maybe i cannot finish My "Tugas Akhir"* I want to finish it, but i was too tired, my energy for writing to research already Gone, because i'm to tired, like maybe i cannot coding anymore because it's where's parts i love in the next months but as time going i hate it

Is **Vibe Coding** Yeah kinda joke Internet but there reasons, i hate and not hate, i'm note hate because it's help me make a program That Too Deep For me, yeah i can code but for smaller due to i don't too much energy for Code

**But's** It's getting me tired, and back to topic where i ask my parents, i wanna say i wanna maybe **"Rest"** For Two Reasons: 1. I was thinking why i *Kinda Flexing* To Somebody that i know in future i'm gonna tired because my flexing
2. i wanna improve myself but idk if i can do it, but back then 2023 i was thinking to learn about math and improve my code on Back 2023, My code is sucks still this days i can say sucks but it's works but yeah spaghetti Code but atleast yeah every day i get complan yada yada but, i feel i was working alone

Maybe if i doing something that end up good for me but i know it's kinda Good To be True

Like But where parts i not code that i need to fix that, i don't wanna do it because i know one days i gonna mess up but they want to do it fast but in then end spaghetti code and i feel i need rest for 2 days (because Holiday Days)

Maybe that's it see yeah
